At the forefront in the war against pollution and a step to a greener earth

## Polycoin

A token that can be traded for plastic.

The project includes a merchant dashboard and a recyclers dashboard. The merchants dashboard can place orders for plastic which they will then use to create products which they can sell to the market. The recyclers can accept those orders and reward civilians who bring plastic to recycling centers for recycling.

### How to run

The project is built using vanilla HTML/CSS so it can be served using any web server such as apache, or the files opened directly.
